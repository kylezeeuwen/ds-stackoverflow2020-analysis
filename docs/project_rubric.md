# Feedback Round 1

* (    ) more markdown documentation in the notebooks
* (    ) Notebook 4 more docs make more clear
* (    ) notebook markdown - Business Context of the analysis
* (    ) List of questions you are trying to answer with the analysis
* (    ) Some missing DOCSTRING - specifically compute_multiple_choice_response_stats
* (    ) Segment code into CRISP-DM. Resource : https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/08/21/the-data-science-process-crisp-dm/

```markdown
        Identify the segments that are applicable to the analysis and segment your codes
        
        * Business Understanding
        * Data Understanding
        * Prepare Data
        * Data Modeling
        * Evaluate the Results
```

* (    ) PEP8 standards - can use autopep8 to lint
* (    ) Better documentation of data prep (what was dropped, what was imputed, rationale) - It is very important to document the methods used in the analysis and add reasons for using them.


Also you can consider adding introduction / business context for the analysis
